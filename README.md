 School Math and Reading Trends by School Type
-----------------------------------------------
Charter Schools scored higher than the District School Types in both Math and Reading Test Scores.
The budget per student did not vary much by school type, however the school size seemed to impact the test scores.
The larger the school size in total number of students,the lower the overall test scores in both math and reading.
